Before you select a specific topic type, it is important to understand the different type of topic types in DITA. 

## Common Topic Types in DITA

### What is DITA topic?

DITA topic is a  XML object where you document for your software documentation. To understand it simply, we create a new slide everytime we want to input a new information in a presentation. The information in the slide can be topical, graphical, or just a seperator. 

But, when we talk about DITA, we create a new XML object every time we want to introduce a new topic. For instance, lets say you are software documentation for SmartPen App. 
```
<DITA MAP> Getting started with SmartPen App
<topic 1> What is SmartPen App?
<topic 2> How to get started with SmartPen App?
<topic 3> What's New in SmartPen App
```

You documentation will not necessarily have topics that looks like this, but this can help you build a foundational understanding of DITA topics.

Moving ahead, we know that DITA specifications demands structured writing. Structured writing and organising your content becomes easier when you know about the type of information you will be presenting to the target audience. Once your concept is clear in terms of gathering and presenting information, this will make your task of choosing and appropriate topic type easy. 

>*The structure of structured writing is presented by DITA topics*

#### Task
- ==**"How to"**== type of documents
- Information about the ==steps users can follow== to achieve desired results or goals.

#### Concept
- ==**What's this**== type of information is presented in this topic type
- ==Conceptual information.== 
- ==Features or architectural== descriptions and definitions

#### Reference
- Can be user for almost ==**anything and everything**==
- The most common scenarios where reference topics are used is when somebody has a large amount of data/information to document
- Admin User Control documentation is one example.
