The first steps of getting started with DITA is to create a DITA Map. But, before that, it is essential to learn the fundamentals of DITA. 

## What is a DITA Map?

- DITA Maps are very similar to TOCs. It is the way of organising and presenting documentation/information in a structured format. 

> [!Note] Table of Content in DITA is a entirely different element, this is point is just provide a point of reference for a better understanding

- It presents information in logical hierarchy and resources are organised outside of the actual concept. 

>[!Note] The DITA maps allow you to provide this overall context in which you point to those specific topics and to resources. And then find them and resolve them.

DITA topics are standalone objects which are a smaller picture of something very huge. A topic can help you get answers for specific things like how to use a pen, different parts of pen, etc. 

When it comes delivering these topics in deliverables, these topics need to be presented in a structured format. One way of doing so is by preparing a table of content and then delivering it to the audience. But, what if you do not want to deliver every topic?

Well, in that case, DITA Maps comes into the picture. DITA Maps is like a bag, a bag where you store all your topics. At any given point, you can pick topic from your bag and deliver it to your target audience.
