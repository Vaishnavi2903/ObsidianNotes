## MAPS
- In DITA the documentation you write is structures and organised through DITA maps. 
- DITA [[decouples]] what you have written from how it is structured. Basically, it allows you to focus on the writing without worrying about the structcuring. 
- The structure of the content is presented using DITA Maps and mentions only the topic that belongs to it.
