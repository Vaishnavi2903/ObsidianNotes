- In order to be able to write documentation in DITA. You need to know the structured writing in DITA. 
- We usually adobt the style called *writing based on information* types
- This literally means defining a set of templates to go for and write inside them.
- DITA defines some of the most popular information types -Task, Concept and Reference. These information types are essential to start writing on DITA, so ensure that you have a better understanding on of at least these popular information types. 

## MAPS
- In DITA the documentation you write is structures and organised through DITA maps. 
- DITA [[decouples]] what you have written from how it is structured. Basically, it allows you to focus on the writing without worrying about the structcuring. 
- The structure of the content is presented using DITA Maps and mentions only the topic that belongs to it. 

> [!Tips] 
> It might take a while for you to write keeping maps in mind or to work around maps. But, the it is good to have a foundation understanding before starting with DITA XML

## Strict Guidelines
When someone is working as content writer or comfortable in domain which is less of technical writing, DITA can sometimes feel challenging. DITA can be so strict at times that you cannot even enter a single paragraph wherever you want within a topic. This is where practice and learning comes handy.

Technical writers are required to follow a strict guidelines while working with DITA XML. You need to build a habit of thinking about the rules of writing and standards of DITA when documenting anything. 

Everything you write in DITA has a meaning in itself. So the content needs to be curated in modularized and reusable format. It should be presented and written in a way that each section, each module can later be reused into a different user guide altogether.

## Context Free Content

Writing in anything in DITA needs to be context-free. what does it mean? It means that everything you write in DITA need not to be specific to any particular topic or reference in your content further. You as a author must create a content that is:
- Capabilities of being influenced by the topic outside from your material.
- Context-free, meaning no references like "take a look at the bullet point number 3" or "take a look at this topic". This is followed simply because nobody at this point knows whether that topic or reference exists in your content.

## Requirements of Information Architecture in DITA

### Different Level of Content Reuse
 - You will be governing the organization and information of your content
 - You will be enabled to use different levels of content. What are the different levels you ask? [Refer to this link to know more about the different levels and elements of DITA](https://www.oxygenxml.com/dita/1.3/specs/langRef/containers/element-quick-reference.html)
 - Reusing and linking the entire deliverables, different maps, topics or specific topic elements. You can go very very deep when reusing content in DITA. Since, every line has a meaning of its own, DITA specifically opens a wide opportunity when talking about reusing content.

### Linking Strategies
DITA empowers to adopt a linking strategies. The process of linking is automated once you finalize your linking strategy. Usually writers spend a lot of time linking their content. Amidst the linking, updating, and linking again, the result turns out to be a broken link. So, DITA helps you avoid any broken link by automating the process.

Even though DITA makes linking feel like a little less, adopting the right linking strategy requires some thinking. 

### Filtering and Flagging Based on Profiling
- Information Architects are responsible for content personalisation. 
- This can be done with the help of persona's, knowing about your target audience, and the information they need. 
- You can later adopt a profiling strategy to represent their needs and information. 
- The rule for any profiling strategy is simple:
	- You should know what you need
	- You should know your target audience
	- Input accurate information 
These rules are straightforward, it will become an aid in always getting the right content to the right target audience.
