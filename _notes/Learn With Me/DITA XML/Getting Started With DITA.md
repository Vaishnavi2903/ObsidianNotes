Title: Getting Started with DITA
---
To get started with DITA we will first need a DITA authoring tool. There are multiple tools available in the market today. We will be learning using the Oxygen XML. 

> [Download Oxygen XML editor here](https://www.oxygenxml.com "Oxygen XML download")

## Why Learn DITA?
A question that simply striked my mind right after I was finished buying my udemy course is *Why do I need to learn DITA or XML when I am already a good enough technical writer?*

I have been using MadCap Flare for documentation for a very long time and it never occured to me that I should learn DITA. But, if we look at the future of software documentation I believe having an extensive knowledge of a structured form of writing would benefit me. This additional skill will not only help me enhance my knowledge about technical writing but also increase my chance of securing a job in a Fortune 500 company.
